[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

## Lazy Solution
I hear that a good data scientist is a lazy data scientist.

The distribution of height among males in the U.S. is normal with a mean of
178cm, and a standard deviation of 7.7. To be a member of the Blue Man group you
must be a male between 178cm and 185cm. This is roughly one standard deviation
above the mean height. Therefore roughly speaking, a total of 34% of U.S. males
are eligible.

## The Hypothesis

[Note: I'm not sure that there is a hypothesis in this question as no claim is
made on a particular group]
